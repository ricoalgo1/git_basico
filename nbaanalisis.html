<P>
<h3> There is no doubt that Kevin Durant is a top-10 scoring talent of all time ,
    because he has no comparison in terms of being a 6'10‚Äù sharpshooter with a wingspan that extends over 7 feet. 
    In raw talent, Durant has a solid argument for being one of the most uniquely unstoppable players to ever play the game
    In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. 
     As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) 
     and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history.
      He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.
      To finish, Durant has won two NBA championships, an NBA MVP Award, two Finals MVP Awards, an NBA Rookie of the season, and two Olympic Gold medals.
       He is also one of the highest-earning basketball players off the court, thanks to his various endorsement deals,
        and has an excellent philanthropic reputation </h3>
